In this meeting, we worked on completing the requirements for Project Milestone 2.
We created a Functional and Non-Functional features list.
Features lists contain feature names and short descriptions.
We discussed and decided to use User Stories as project requirements since we are using the Agile model.
Each team member decided on a feature to write a User Story for.
We begun working on User Stories for the 6 features we chose.
